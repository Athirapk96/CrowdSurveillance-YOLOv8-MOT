# üëÅÔ∏èCrowdSurveillance-YOLOv8-MOT

***Real-time crowd monitoring and multi-object tracking using YOLOv8 and state-of-the-art MOT algorithms***

##  Overview
CrowdSurveillance-YOLOv8-MOT brings together state-of-the-art deep learning and tracking for automated video-based surveillance. The project integrates YOLOv8 for high-performance object detection with multiple proven trackers, enabling a comparative study and real-world deployment. It supports both crowd counting and analysis of crowd movement direction in surveillance footage.

## Demo
Check out the example output (output.mp4) included in the repository for a quick demonstration of detection and tracking in action.
